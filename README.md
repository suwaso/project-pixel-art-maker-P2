# project-pixel-art-maker-P2

What Will I Build?
You’ll build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas! Check out this example:

Pixel Art Image of Udacity Logo
You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

What Skills Do I Need?
In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills including:

Defining variables with const and let
Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
Writing nested loops and using loop variables
How Does This Help My Career?
Interacting with the DOM — the structure of a web page — is one of the most fundamental skills for a front-end web developer. Mastering event listeners is essential to creating user interfaces — and to quite a few other things.
